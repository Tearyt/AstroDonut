# AstroDonut
AstroDonut is a Python package for generating synthetic elliptical ring structuresâ€”ideal for simulating protoplanetary or circumstellar disks such as HL Tauri. These artificial models can be used as input for telescope simulators like ScopeSim (for the ELT) and can be exported as FITS files for further scientific use.
